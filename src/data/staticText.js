I am a software engineer, and completed my integrated masters in Computer Science at the University of Bristol in 2023.
My interests in the field include machine learning, AI, computer vision and computer graphics.
I also enjoy pursuing a deep understanding of algorithms, data structures and software engineering techniques.

I built this website using ReactJS and introduce a selection of my favourite projects.
Among these are coursework from University and school as well as personal projects.

Outside of Computer Science, my main hobbies and interests are swimming, martial arts, piano and stop motion animation.
